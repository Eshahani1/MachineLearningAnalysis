# Machine Learning Predictive Analysis on US Car Accidents

## Overview

This project focuses on using machine learning to analyze and predict patterns in US car accidents. The dataset provides detailed information about accident occurrences, and the goal is to identify key factors influencing accident rates and develop predictive models.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze historical data on US car accidents.
- Identify key features contributing to accidents.
- Develop predictive models to forecast accident occurrences.
- Evaluate model performance and compare different machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle, containing information on car accidents in the United States. Key features include accident location, weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant details. Link to dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents 

## Technologies Used
